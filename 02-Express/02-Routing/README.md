### Understanding Routing 🚦

Routing is like guiding traffic but on the web. It helps requests (URLs) find their way in our app to get the right response.

### Nested Routing 🛤️

Nested routing is like having roads inside other roads. It helps manage big apps by breaking them into smaller parts.

### Callback Functions 💃🎵

Callbacks are like dance moves in our code. Sometimes it's a solo, sometimes a team dance—each doing a special job when handling requests.

### Breakdown of Callbacks:

#### Single Callback Function 🎶
- One function, one route—simple and effective.
- Sets the mood immediately when a route is used.
- Only one response gets the spotlight!

#### More Than One Callback 🚀
- A sequence of functions working together for a route's journey.
- No sending two responses! 🚫 Remember to use the `next()` command to keep things flowing!

#### Array of Functions 🌟
- A team effort—multiple functions collaborating for a smooth experience.
- It's like a mixtape of callbacks. Keep things moving with `next()`!

#### Combination of Both 🎉
- A mix of solo and team callbacks.
- Only one response allowed—no extra guests at the party!

### Understanding HTTP Methods in Express 🌐

HTTP methods are the tools we use to interact with our server, defining the kind of action we want to perform on a resource.

#### GET Method 🚀
- **GET** requests data from a specified resource.

#### POST Method 📨
- **POST** sends data to a server to create a new resource.

#### PUT Method 🔁
- **PUT** updates data on the server.

#### DELETE Method 🚫
- **DELETE** deletes a specified resource.

#### PATCH Method 🌳
- **PATCH** applies partial modifications to a resource.
  


#### Using `.route()` for a Common Path 🌟

The `.route()` method simplifies handling multiple HTTP methods for a shared path. Here's how it's used:

```javascript
app.route('/http-methods')
  .get((req, res) => {
    res.send('Received a GET request! Time to fetch some unicorns 🦄');
  })
  .post((req, res) => {
    res.send('Received a POST request! Your message has been teleported 📨✨');
  });

## Node.js Modules: The Basics

In Node.js, every JavaScript file is like its own mini world, known as a Common JS or Node JS Module. When these modules want to share stuff, they use Module Exports.

### Common JS Module Exports
- **Default Exports:** It's like sending a special gift as the main export.
- **Named Exports:** Imagine making a checklist of things you want to share and labeling them.

### Modern JS Module Exports
- **Default Exports:** Similar to Common JS but fancier.
- **Named Exports:** The cool way of sharing specific things.

## Getting to Know Modules in Node.js

A module in Node.js is like a box of JavaScript tools ready for your coding adventures. It's like having a library of functions at your fingertips.

### Core Modules
Node.js comes with its own superheroes—Core Modules:
- **path:** Helps with file paths, like a trusty sidekick.
- **fs:** Guards the file system, keeping everything in order.
- **url:** Masters the art of parsing URL strings, making web navigation a breeze.

### Your Turn: Unleash Your Creativity with Modules
But wait, there's more! You can create your own modules. Think of them as your personal code helpers. Need a function to calculate something, a class to organize data, or a utility to simplify a task? You can make it and share it!

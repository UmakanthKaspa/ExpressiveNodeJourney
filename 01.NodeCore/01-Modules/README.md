## Node.js Modules: The Basics ✨

In Node.js, every JavaScript file is like its own mini world, known as a Common JS or Node JS Module. When these modules want to share stuff, they use Module **Exports**.

### Common JS Module Exports
- **Default Exports:** 🎁 It's like sending a special gift as the main **export**.
- **Named Exports:** 📋 Imagine making a checklist of things you want to **share and labeling them**.

### Modern JS Module Exports
- **Default Exports:** ✨ Similar to Common JS but **fancier**.
- **Named Exports:** 🔖 The **fancy** way of **handpicking** what you want to share, like choosing the finest ingredients for your coding recipe book.


## Getting to Know Modules in Node.js 📦

A **module** in Node.js is like a box of JavaScript tools ready for your coding adventures. It's like having a **library** of functions at your fingertips.

### Core Modules
Node.js comes with its own superheroes—Core Modules:
- **path:** Helps with file **paths**, like a trusty sidekick.
- **fs:** Guards the file **system**, keeping everything in order.
- **url:** Masters the art of parsing URL strings, making web **navigation** a breeze.

### Your Turn: Unleash Your Creativity with Modules 🚀
But wait, there's more! You can create your own modules. Think of them as your personal code helpers. Need a function to **calculate** something, a **class** to organize data, or a **utility** to simplify a task? You can make it and **share** it!
